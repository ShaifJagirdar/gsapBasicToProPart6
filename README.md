#GSAP Text Animation Project
This project demonstrates a dynamic text animation using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). Each character of the text is animated individually for a visually appealing entrance effect.

#Features
Dynamic Character Splitting
The text content is split into individual characters, each wrapped in a <span> for targeted animations.
Smooth Text Animations
Each character fades in and slides up with staggered timing for a fluid animation effect.
Fully Customizable
Easily modify the text, animation duration, and effects to suit your needs.
